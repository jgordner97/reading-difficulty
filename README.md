# reading-difficulty

This is a repository for a web app that tells you the reading difficulty of a given text. Right now, it has many issues. Most notably, it does not work if you submit an advanced text and then try to submit a less advanced text without refreshing the page. 

I would also like to add functionality to be able to type in a title of a book, get a snippet of that book from a source such as books.google, and return a reading level value.
